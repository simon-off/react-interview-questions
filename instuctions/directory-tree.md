# Directory Tree

https://youtu.be/ixgxx_um8r8

In this coding challenge, you will create a directory tree structure using React. The goal is to build a component that can display a hierarchical representation of directories and files, similar to what you see in a typical file explorer.

1. Create a React component called DirectoryTree.
2. Create an object representing the directory tree.
   - It should be a nested object with directories containing files and sub-directories.
   - You only need to store the names of the files, no actual file content.
3. Implement a feature to expand/collapse directories when clicked.
4. Apply basic CSS styling to make it visually presentable.
