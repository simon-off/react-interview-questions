      <h1>What is this site?</h1>
      <p>
        This site contains a collection of <b>React Interview Questions</b> I've collected from
        various sources on the internet. I created it to practice and learn more about React and
        JavaScript in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're at a similar stage in your frontend developer journey, perhaps it can be useful to
        you as well!
      </p>
      <h2>Where's the good stuff?</h2>
      <p>
        In the navigation to the left you will find all the challenges. Each one has its own page
        with info of where I found it, instructions on how to implement it and the result of my own
        implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to dig into the code and see how I solved the challenges you can check out{" "}
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/simon-off/react-interview-questions">
          the repo over on GitHub
        </a>
        . It contains all the source code for the challenges as well as this entire site. Thank you
        for stopping by and good luck on your own React journey!
