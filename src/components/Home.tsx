      <h1>What is this site?</h1>
      <p>
        This site contains a collection of <b>React Interview Questions</b> I've
        collected from various sources on the internet. I made it so that I
        could practice and learn more about React and JavaScript in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're at a similar stage in your frontend developer journey, perhaps
        it can be useful to you as well!
      </p>
      <h2>Where's the good stuff?</h2>
      <p>
        In the navigation to the left you will find all the challenges. Each one
        has its own page with info of where I found it, instructions on how to
        implement it and the result of my own implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to dig into the code and see how I solved the challenges you
        can check out{" "}
